* THINGS TO DO
** DONE would be nice to be able to specify if a sprite animation is continuous or should have a delay
*** maybe we should shadow the animations map into the sprite container and provide details there?
*** maybe we can just add more data into the animations map and use that?
** DONE should display the name of the current sprite on screen (:sprite-group)
** DONE should display the name of the current animation on screen
** TODO would be nice to be able to specify a sequence of animations to execute
*** would want to specify a period in frames or cycles for each animation
